    <h5>FAVORITE MOVIE - TROY</h5>

    <p> I love this Movie because it is so well taken in terms of Cinematography. It is a Period Drama, which would need its Cast to really get to know the actual History behind this Movie. I really feel that Brad Pitt has excellently potrayed the Character of the Greek Hero, Achilles.</p>
